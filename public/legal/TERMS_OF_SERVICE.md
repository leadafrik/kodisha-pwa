## 7. Launch period

During the initial launch period, all listing types are free. No subscription, commission, boost, or verification fees are currently charged.

Future monetization, with at least 30 days' notice, may include:
- Listing plans (flat fee or percentage model).
- Optional visibility boosts.
- Verification tiers.
- Transaction commissions (product sales, rentals, services).

In-platform payment flows are currently disabled. Users must independently arrange off-platform payments. Agrisoko does not process, hold, escrow, or guarantee payments during this period.

Because fees are not being charged during the launch period, no VAT or commission-related tax withholding applies. Users remain responsible for taxes on any independent transactions they arrange.

Users may not misrepresent platform status or imply official Agrisoko payment facilitation while payments are not yet active.

---

## 8. Verification services

Identity verification may include National ID, KRA PIN, phone number, and physical address confirmation. Verification does not guarantee trustworthiness or eliminate fraud risk.

We may offer optional title deed verification in partnership with licensed surveyors. Verification indicates document authenticity but does not guarantee ownership rights. Users should conduct independent due diligence.

Verified badges indicate completed verification steps and do not constitute an endorsement or guarantee. We may revoke badges if information becomes inaccurate.

---

## 9. Intellectual property rights

Agrisoko owns all rights, title, and interest in the platform, including software, code, algorithms, trademarks, logos, branding, design, layout, and proprietary data.

By posting content, you grant Agrisoko a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to display, reproduce, distribute, and use your content for marketing and promotional purposes, and to modify it for technical compatibility.

You retain ownership of content you post, and you represent and warrant that you have the rights to all content you post and that it does not infringe third-party rights.

---

## 10. Disclaimers and limitation of liability

The platform is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis without warranties of any kind.

We do not guarantee:
- Uninterrupted or error-free platform operation.
- Accuracy, completeness, or reliability of content.
- User conduct or transaction completion.
- Security against unauthorized access or data loss.
- Compatibility with your devices or systems.

You acknowledge that you use the platform at your own risk, and you are responsible for verifying user identities and listing accuracy. Conduct independent due diligence, obtain appropriate insurance, and seek professional advice as needed.

To the maximum extent permitted by Kenyan law, Agrisoko and its directors, officers, employees, and agents will not be liable for indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages, loss of profits or data, personal injury or property damage, fraudulent or criminal conduct by users, disputes between users, or losses exceeding fees paid to Agrisoko in the preceding 12 months.

Nothing in these Terms excludes liability that cannot be excluded under Kenyan consumer protection law.

## 11. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Agrisoko, its affiliates, and their respective directors, officers, employees, and agents against claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, or expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising from:
- Your violation of these Terms.
- Your violation of any law or third-party rights.
- Your content or listings.
- Transactions or disputes with other users.
- Your negligence or willful misconduct.

## 12. Dispute resolution

Users agree to first attempt to resolve disputes through good-faith negotiation.

If negotiation fails, disputes shall be referred to mediation under the Nairobi Centre for International Arbitration Mediation Rules.

Unresolved disputes shall be settled by arbitration under the Arbitration Act (1995):
- Seat of arbitration: Nairobi, Kenya.
- Language: English.
- Number of arbitrators: One for disputes under KSh 5,000,000; three for larger disputes.

## 13. Privacy and data protection

Our collection, use, and protection of personal data is governed by our Privacy Policy and complies with the Data Protection Act (2019).

By using the platform, you consent to our data practices as described in the Privacy Policy.

## 14. Termination

You may terminate your account at any time by contacting support, using in-app account deletion features, or sending written notice to our registered address.

We may suspend or terminate your account immediately if you breach these Terms, we suspect fraud or illegal activity, we are required by law or court order, or we cease platform operations (with 30 days' notice).

Upon termination:
- Your access to the platform will cease.
- Active listings will be removed.
- You remain liable for outstanding fees.
- Sections 9 to 12 and 14 to 17 survive termination.

---

## 15. Modifications to terms

We may modify these Terms at any time. Changes are effective upon posting with a revised last updated date.

For material changes, we will provide notice via email, in-app notification, or a prominent platform announcement. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance of updated Terms.

---

## 16. General provisions

These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Kenya. Subject to the arbitration provisions, the courts of Kenya have exclusive jurisdiction over disputes.

These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and Agrisoko.

If any provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in full force and effect.

No waiver of any term shall constitute a continuing waiver or waiver of any other term.

You may not assign or transfer these Terms without our written consent. We may assign these Terms to any affiliate or successor.

Neither party is liable for failure to perform due to circumstances beyond reasonable control, including acts of God, war, terrorism, riots, embargoes, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, earthquakes, pandemic, or strikes.

## 17. Special provisions for agricultural transactions

Users acknowledge that agricultural activities are subject to weather, pests, disease, and market fluctuations. Agrisoko is not responsible for crop failures, natural disasters, or price volatility.

Users must comply with the Environmental Management and Coordination Act (1999) and avoid activities that cause environmental degradation.

Users listing or selling agricultural inputs must comply with the Pest Control Products Act and only advertise properly registered and labeled products.

Livestock sales must comply with the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act. Animals must be transported and treated humanely.
